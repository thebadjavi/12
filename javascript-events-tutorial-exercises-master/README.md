## Local Installation

1) Make sure you have [learnpack](https://github.com/learnpack/learnpack-cli) installed and `node.js` version v14+ and jest v27. This is the command to install the learnpack-cli and jest:

$ npm i learnpack jest@27.0.6 -g
```

2) Clone or download this repository. Once you finish downloading, you will find a new folder with a subdirectory "exercises" that contains all the exercises within.

3) Install the learnpack plugin to test and compile vanillajs:
```sh
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-dom
```

4) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ learnpack start
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
1. **index.html:** represents the entry website.
1. **style.css:** your website styles, they have to be imported from the index.html
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
